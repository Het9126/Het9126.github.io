    <h3>A car or an automobile is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily
        on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people, not cargo.</h3>
    <h3>The first steam-powered vehicle was designed by Ferdinand Verbiest, a Flemish member of a Jesuit mission in
        China around 1672. It was a 65-centimetre-long (26 in) scale-model toy for the Kangxi Emperor that was unable to
        carry a driver or a passenger.It is not known with certainty if Verbiest's model was successfully built or
        run.Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot is widely credited with building the first full-scale, self-propelled mechanical
        vehicle in about 1769; he created a steam-powered tricycle.[26] He also constructed two steam tractors for the
        French Army, one of which is preserved in the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts. His inventions
        were limited by problems with water supply and maintaining steam pressure.In 1801, Richard Trevithick built and
        demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive, believed by many to be the first demonstration of a
        steam-powered road vehicle. It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods and was of
        little practical use.</h3>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">A sports car is a car designed with an emphasis
                        on
                        dynamic
                        performance, such as handling, acceleration, top speed, or thrill of driving. Sports cars
                        originated
                        in
                        Europe
                        in the early 1900s and are currently produced by many manufacturers around the world.</p>

                        old
                        automobile,
                        and in the narrower senses of car enthusiasts and collectors, it is a car from the period of
                        1919 to
                        1930.
                        Such
                        enthusiasts have categorization schemes for ages of cars that enforce distinctions between

                        cars,
                        vintage

                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Supercars are essentially a high-performance
                        luxury
                        type of
                        sports car. This means their design includes premium car parts, they have more power and more
                        advanced
                        technology. Whilst still classified as 'street legal', supercars are rarer and harder to handle
                        than
                        sports
                        cars.</p>
